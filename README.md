## Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) given a image of an article of clothing, identify the type of the piece of clothing

### How do I get set up? ###

### Training the network

#### Training the network requires you to download the MNIST fashion dataset and feed that file path to the network
#### The `.h5` file containing the weights will be created in the `output/` folder

### Running the network

#### Place the path to the weights in the `cnn.py` 
#### Input a path to an image as the input to the network
#### Success!!
